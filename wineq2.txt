Changelog

- All Games

- EverQuest 1
  * Fixed breakage issues with the current EQ1 Test server build, in which SOE has decided to compile
    with different options.

2.15 - 8/19/2010
- EverQuest 2
  * Fixed error after logging into a character

2.15 - 8/20/2009
- EverQuest 1
  * Added support for EQGraphicsDX9Orig.dll

2.15 - 11/26/2008
- All games
  * We have reverted the DirectX 9 update requirement to the April 2006 or later update (the same
    as was previously required). Yesterday's update confused an abnormally high number of users due 
    to Microsoft's current DirectX 9 updater problem. Please note that WinEQ 2 does not reqiure you
    to "install DirectX 9.0c". We are aware that everyone already has DirectX 9.0c, which came out
    in 2004, and this is not what the update requirement is. Microsoft releases an update to
    DirectX 9 every 2 months, and these updates are still classified as DirectX 9.0c. 
    
    While we apologize for the confusion, please be aware that sometime in the future (long after the
    simplified update process is fixed at Microsoft) there will likely be a required update. Many new
    games require these updates as well.

2.15 - 11/25/2008
- All games
  * WinEQ 2 now requires the March 2008 (or later) update to DirectX 9. Unfortunately at this time,
    the Microsoft DirectX 9 updater fails to download the update when using the usual update method.
    If WinEQ 2 complains to you about needing this update, you may need to use the following link:
    http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=886ACB56-C91A-4A8E-8BB8-9F20F1244A8E&displaylang=en
    Once downloaded, you will need to install it into a temporary folder. It will install a DXSETUP,
    which you will need to run. After doing so, the temporary folder can be removed. 
- EverQuest II
  * Fixed problems introduced by today's EverQuest II patch

2.15 - 10/04/2008
- All games
  * Fixed sticky CTRL / ALT / SHIFT keys once and for all

2.15 - 01/19/2008
- EverQuest 1
 * Fixed "resolution reset" bug when changing game resolution with EverQuest itself in Full Screen 
   mode.

2.15 - 11/27/2007
- EverQuest 1
 * EverQuest's new functionality of setting CPU affinity (the cores on which to run a game session)
   is now disabled if WinEQ's CPU affinity functionality is enabled. The WinEQ setting is found
   in the WinEQ 2.0, General category.

2.15 - 11/16/2007
- EverQuest 1
  * EQPlayNice functionality has been restored

2.15 - 10/8/2007
- This follow-up patch fixes crashes relating to the display of overlayed text, such as when
  using Reset Window, or when scaling the window size in EverQuest 2

2.15 - 10/8/2007
- Crashes that began as a result of the WinEQ 2 patch should now be fixed. As it is unclear 
  exactly which bugs are now fixed and which are not, please continue reporting any problems,
  as we may have assumed your issue has been solved by this fix.

2.15 - 10/6/2007
- EverQuest 1
 * The vast majority of graphics-related issues should now be fixed. Please continue reporting
   any problems.

2.15 - 9/2/2007
- EverQuest 1
 * LaunchPad compatibility fixed
 * Fixed loading-related crashes (including reload UI), hopefully (thanks Sam)

2.15 - 7/17/2007
- All games: 
 * Fixed d3dx9_30.dll detection
- EverQuest II
 * Fixed mouselook issue caused by restoring the window by mouse after minimizing

2.15 - 6/15/2007
- EverQuest II
 * Fixed bug where the game window could not be restored after minimizing

2.15 - 6/9/2007
- All games:
 * Added various text descriptions of numeric error codes, along with suggestions as to how to
   remedy the problems.
- EverQuest II
 * Fixed issue where clicking on an EQ2 session to activate it would trigger mouselook
- World of Warcraft
 * Fixed startup crashes

2.14 - 8/26/2006
- World of Warcraft:
  * Fixed bugs with the title bar and borders with the WoW 1.12 patch
  * Multiple monitor support for Pro users has been expanded to 4 monitors

2.14 - 8/10/2006
- EverQuest 1:
  * Multiple monitor support for Pro users has been expanded to 4 monitors

2.14 - 6/27/2006
- All games:
  * The April 2006 update to DirectX 9 is now required.  If this is not installed on your
    system, a box will pop up upon running WinEQ 2 that will allow you to hit OK to be 
    taken to the download, or hit Cancel to find it on your own.
- EverQuest 1:
  * Expanded Tiling support.  The scale factor, previously always 0.5 (half of the screen in each
    direction, meaning an *area* of 1/4 of the screen), can now be set per profile based on foreground 
    or background.  By default, the scale factor is now 0.6 for foreground sessions, and 0.5 for 
    background.
  * Fixed bug with moving the game window when using secondary display

2.13 - 3/23/2006
- All games:
  * Fixed issue with untiling and re-tiling with profile-defined tiles
  * Improved error messages from account verification

2.13 - 2/6/2006
- All games:
  * This patch now uses D3DX dynamically linked (d3dx9_27.dll), which is handled by the patcher.
  * Support for extra mouse buttons in WinEQ 2 hotkeys (not including Global Activation, which are
    governed by Windows) has been added.  The key names are as follows:
    ** MButton - Middle button
    ** XButton1 - Left side button
    ** XButton2 - Right side button
    Note that XButton2 is not currently available in DirectInput games (EQ1 definitely, maybe DAOC), 
    because DirectInput was originally designed for 4-button mice, not 5-button.  Newer DirectInput 
    stuff supports 8-button, so I will have to do some conversion work.
- Dark Age of Camelot:
  * The issue that caused DAoC to close prematurely at startup should now be fixed
- EverQuest:
  * Fixed bug that hid the mouse cursor when using shift+right click to access the context menu
  * Added EQ beta patcher support.  You can set your profile to use the beta server under the 
    "Test/Beta Server" option.  The beta was previously usable with WinEQ 2 by using the appropriate
    path and enabling the Test server option, with patching disabled.  EQPlayNice will not support 
    the beta server, so you will see a popup from it saying it is not compatible, but WinEQ 2 will 
    continue to work just fine.

2.13 - 11/8/2005
- EverQuest:
  * Remaining mouse problems for WinEQ 2 Lite users should be solved

2.13 - 11/4/2005
- EverQuest:
  * As of this patch, we believe we have solved problems related to the new EQ mouse code.  This
    includes mouse clicks errantly dragging in-game windows, clicking outside of the window during
    mouselook, mouse scaling (where the mouse position APPEARS to the upper left, or lower right
    of where the actual cursor is), and so on.
    
    Please continue to report any problems you experience

2.13 - 11/4/2005
- EverQuest:
  * The Shift+Right Click (by default) hotkey for showing the WinEQ context menu has returned.
    Right clicking on the very top pixel of the game portion of the window will no longer display
    the context menu
  * The mouse is now resricted to the game window while the right mouse button is pressed.
    Otherwise, the mouse actually travels beyond the window and may actually result in clicking
    the close button or other such annoyances.
  * An option has been added to stop WinEQ 2 Pro from removing the distortion that is otherwise 
    present when using normal EQ windowed, EQWindows, WinEQ 2 Lite, WinEQ 1, etc.  The option is
    called "Dont normalize" and is under EverQuest, General in the WinEQ 2 Preferences window

2.12 - 11/2/2005
- EverQuest:
  * Full screen and windowed resolutions are now forced to be equal.  WinEQ 2 now starts with
    the game set to full screen (which has no mouse cursor issues) instead of windowed (in
    which EQ tries to do its own mouse scaling, but does not do it properly...).  The mouse
    works correctly in both modes in our testing...

2.12 - 11/1/2005
- EverQuest:
  * Fixed remaining mouse cursor scaling problems
  * Fixed Picture-in-Picture defaults.  Apparently, no scale was set by default for PIP windows,
    which confused many people.  Any profile with a PIP scale of 0 will have its PIP size and
    position reset

2.12 - 11/1/2005
- EverQuest:
  * Removed hotkey that used to bring up the same context menu that can be retrieved by clicking
	on the game window's title bar.  The hotkey defaulted to Shift+Right Click and only existed
	because you had to release the mouse to right click on the title bar before the recent EQ
	patch.  Since this is no longer necessary and is now only an inconvenience, this has been
	removed.
  * WinEQ 2 Lite users should no longer have problems using EQ's stored window position

2.12 - 11/1/2005
- EverQuest:
  * Fixed issue for WinEQ 2 Lite users described as the mouse location being in the MIDDLE
    of the cursor, instead of at the point

2.12 - 11/1/2005
- EverQuest:
  * Fixed mouse scaling issue if the window was scaled when switching the game itself from 
    full screen to windowed mode

2.12 - 10/30/2005
- EverQuest:
  * Fixed runaway mouse cursor with mouselook

2.12 - 10/28/2005 and 10/29/2005
- EverQuest:
  * Updated for new mouse code
  * Fixed full screen issues that were present
  * Fixed resolution change issue due to new eqclient.ini settings
  * Slowness issues due to extra debugging information from the new mouse code are fixed

2.12 - 10/13/2005
- WinEQ 2 is once again correctly setting CPU affinity for the correct number of prcoessors,
  instead of 1 less than you really have (so on a 2 CPU system *sigh, including dual core and
  hyperthreading*, it was only using the first CPU)
- WinEQ 2 general preferences display issue fixed for good ;)
- Auto-tiling now works properly

2.12 - 10/9/2005
- Fixed WinEQ 2 "General" preferences not saving and loading correctly
- Fixed issue with CPU affinity setting

2.12 - 9/26/2005
- Display issue with WinEQ 2 "General" Preferences should be solved
- All Games:
  * Picture-in-Picture now defaults to ON per profile in new installations.  This should make it
    easier for new subscribers to figure it out, as it would only require setting the master
    switch in the main program.
- Dark Age of Camelot
  * Fixed "black screen" issue

2.12 - 9/21/2005 pt 2
- Added a "Set CPU Affinity" toggle in the WinEQ 2 General Preferences.  This defaults to on,
  and should only be turned off if you are having problems.

2.12 - 9/21/2005
- Dark Age of Camelot
  * /clientsleep behavior is now dependent on client version setting (Catacombs vs Atlantis),
    and *should* now work correctly for both
- EverQuest
  * Hopefully fixed CPU usage for a few people who were having problems

2.12 - 9/14/2005
- Dark Age of Camelot
  * Hopefully fixed other issue with /clientsleep :)
- EverQuest 1
  * Further improvements to CPU usage

2.12 - 9/12/2005
- Dark Age of Camelot
  * Hopefully fixed issue with /clientsleep

2.12 - 9/11/2005
- All Games
  * Fixed a CPU usage issue

2.12 - 9/10/2005
- EverQuest 1
  * Multithreaded window has been replaced with something that should provide the same effect
    (window updating while zoning or loading) but without other problems

2.11 - 9/9/2005
- EverQuest 1
  * Improved stability (and fixed resolution change issue)

2.11 - 9/8/2005
- All Games
  * Fake d3d9.dll and d3d8.dll files in the game directory will now cause WinEQ 2 to pop up a 
    helpful message instead of just crashing
- EverQuest 1
  * Fixed issue with custom eqclient.ini files with the EQ "options editor" (options button from
    the pre-login menu)

2.11 - 9/2/2005
- EverQuest 1
  * Fixed issue that prevented dragging the window (e.g. to move or resize) before the window 
    is activated (e.g. switching to another app by way of alt+tab, windows key, etc then dragging
    the game window before the window becomes the active window again)

2.11 - 8/31/2005 pt 2
- All Games
  * Fixed Global Bind issue with extended keys (such as Num /, arrow keys, etc)
- EverQuest 1
  * Fixed lag issue from earlier patch today

2.11 - 8/31/2005
- EverQuest 1
  * Using "Close" on the EQ window will immediately end the process

2.11 - 8/31/2005
- All Games
  * Fixed issue with next and previous session keys not opening minimized windows, but still switching
    to them.  Now the windows will be correctly opened.
  * WinEQ will now set CPU affinity on multiple-CPU systems (includes hyperthreaded P4, dual core, etc)
- EverQuest 1
  * Improved behavior when switching windows

2.10 - 8/30/2005 pt 2
- EverQuest 1
  * Fixed issue with manual mouse release and auto-recapturing

2.10 - 8/30/2005
- EverQuest 1
  * Fixed separate issue with sticky keys.  This should be the last of them!

2.10 - 8/29/2005 pt 3
- EverQuest 1
  * Fixed issue with sticky keys when switching sessions

2.10 - 8/29/2005 pt 2
- EverQuest 1:
  * People who exploited Windows to automatically release the mouse from DirectInput (via alt+tab,
    the windows key, etc) to move the window, minimize it, etc, but could not today will have a
    much easier time than ever before!

2.10 - 8/29/2005
- EverQuest 1:
  * Fixed automatic mouse release during loading and zoning with the new window setting.
    Subsequently, the automatically released mouse cursor is now VISIBLE when over the EQ window 
    during the time that it is automatically released.

2.10 - 8/28/2005
- EverQuest 1:
  * Fixed crash with Multithreaded Window option enabled on dual CPU (or hyperthreaded P4, or
    dual core) systems.  The option is now removed, and is always on.  Many people will consider
    this a "new feature" after never having enabled it :)  This also "fixes" the issue with
    Alt+F4 leaking into WinEQ 2 from closing other applications while loading or zoning.

2.10 - 8/24/2005
- Fixed video capture completion crash 

2.10 - 8/15/2005
- All:
  * Fixed issue with runaway windows on dual monitor systems

2.09 - 8/12/2005
- Potentially fixed issue with XFire
- EverQuest 1:
  * Fixed EQPlayNice crash issue with unsupported client versions

2.09 - 8/8/2005
- Everquest 1:
  * The Options Editor (which you get to by clicking Options from the EQ menu before logging in)
    settings now correctly apply to the eqclient.ini file assigned by the current WinEQ profile, 
    and now also uses the same resolution WinEQ uses (instead of being ignored by WinEQ)

2.09 - 8/3/2005
- Dark Age of Camelot:
  * Fixed window scale + targeting bug for Catacombs engine-enabled clients.  Make sure to set the
    client version in your WinEQ 2 profile to Catacombs!

2.09 - 8/1/2005
- All:
  * Tiling works better.  Hitting the tiling hotkey will toggle the current session in and out of
    tiled mode
  * When using window preset hotkeys, pressing the hotkey for the current preset will now revert to
    the previous preset

2.08 update 7/18/2005
- Dark Age of Camelot:
  * Fixed bug with not properly applying window scale for targeting

2.08 update 6/2/2005

- EverQuest:
  * Patching is once again enabled. There was much rejoicing

- EverQuest (2.07a):
  * New Multithreaded Window option allows the window to update while loading or zoning, but may
    cause crashes on some systems when switching windows (off by default)
  * Memory warnings optional
- EverQuest II:
  * Memory warnings optional

2.07
- All:
  * Fixed problem with using non-"Normal" default preset
  * Fixed video capture CPU usage issue

  * Changed mouse handling when releasing/recapturing to be a bit more friendly as far as cursor 
    positioning
- EverQuest II (1.03)
- Warcraft III (1.03)
- World of Warcraft (1.03)

2.05
- All:
  * Fixed image quality degradation previously caused by Pre-shrinking video captures.
    Pre-shrunk video captures should now be nearly indistinguishable from ones that were not,
    and pre-shrinking is now on by default
  * Fixed crash issues with video captures
  * Video encoding process is now switched to lower priority to allow the game to run better
    during that time.  At the end of encoding, a message will pop up in WinEQ sessions saying
    the encoding is completee
- Dark Age of Camelot (1.02)
- EverQuest (2.05):
  * Fixed lockup from using context menu hotkey
  * Fixed problem when using viewport
- EverQuest II (1.02)

- World of Warcraft (1.02)

11/23/2004
- Added a complete dump of loaded modules to SysInfo.txt, removed modules.txt usage
- EverQuest:
  * Moved default position of the window from 4 pixels down to 15 pixels down.  Consequently,
    this will allow people who dont realize their monitor settings arent showing the very top of 
    the display to move the window.  The other games are left at 4 pixels down by default...

11/21/2004
- Implemented a workaround for Xfire users, which works for the current version of Xfire

2.04
- All:

- Warcraft III (1.01)
- World of Warcraft (1.01)

11/18/2004
- EverQuest:
  * Replaced special handling that allowed the EQ window to draw correctly during zoning, but
    fixed the old black screen/reset device failed issues
  * Removed automatic mouse release during loading, zoning, and high lag to solve crashes

2.03
- All:
  * Added video capturing ability for subscribers.  This system is very easy to use, and quite
    configurable.  The resulting video is encoded to WMV format.  * Requires Windows Media Player 9 or
    later
- Dark Age of Camelot (1.00 B6)
- EverQuest (2.03):
  * Removed special handling that allowed the EQ window to draw correctly during zoning, consequently
    solving most of the black screen/reset device failed issues, etc
  * Fixed issue with sticky keys. Consequently, all keys you were holding at the time of switching
    to a new window will have to be re-pressed if you wish to use them again.  This means, for example,
    that if you usually hold CTRL+ALT and tapping X to switch between sessions with the default hotkeys,
    you now will only switch once.  You must let go of CTRL+ALT and press them again.
  * Implemented automatic mouse release during loading, zoning, and high lag (same as WinEQ 1.38)
  * Possibly fixed issue with compatability with MQ2 that essentially pressed every key
- EverQuest II (1.00 B4)
  * Fixed dual monitor support
- Warcraft III (1.00 B4):
  * Added configurable hotkeys to use any of the 6 items on your hero.  This allows you, for example, to
    hit F1 instead of numpad 7 to use an item, which may be much easier to manage
- World of Warcraft (1.00 B4):
  * Fixed many of the "crashes" when quitting the game
  * Fixed dual monitor support
  
11/10/2004

  * Hovering your mouse over the WinEQ 2.0 tray icon now shows Lite or Pro, and for Pro users
    shows your MMOTools Subscription expiration date (time shown is EST or GMT-5)
- All Games:
  * Fixed various typos in preferences
  * Added "Create Desktop Shortcut" menu to each game's menu in the tray program, which allows
    you to create a link on your desktop to open a particular profile directly from your desktop
- Dark Age of Camelot (1.00 B5)
- EverQuest (2.02)
  * Added Alt/Ctrl/Shift/Win indicator below Memory Indicator when enabled.  If you can pinpoint
    a time when these keys seem to get "stuck" down when they should not be, please report it so
    we can solve the problem.
  * Added a hidden "InputDebug" option for non-English locale subscribers to help figure out why
    their keyboard does not seem to work after server select (edit WinEQ-EQ.ini and add
    "InputDebug=1" under [General]).  This will pop up text whenever tjey hit a key if they are a
    subscriber, and we will want information about that from them.
- EverQuest II (1.00 B3)
  * Updated for retail
  * Fixed cursor, it will now take the shape it's supposed to instead of the windows arrow cursor
- World of Warcraft (1.00 B3)
  * Sound does not cut out when your World of Warcraft session goes to the background
- Warcraft III (1.00 B3)

  * If the custom EQClient.ini file does not exist, it will be created from the existing
    EQClient.ini
  * Using a hotkey that should change the appearance of the window will now update the
    window immediately instead of waiting for the next reset
- Dark Age of Camelot:
  * Fixed issue with profiles (always used default previously)
  * Added custom USER.DAT option per profile.  This makes the login window remember the
    information, game resolutions, etc from the last session with that profile
  * Workaround implemented for playing more than 2 characters on one computer
  * Added EQPlayNice-style FPS display and limiting for subscribers
  * Support added and tested for DAOC Classic client

2.0 RC3
- Fixed patcher system, which was inadvertently disabled in RC2
- Fixed problem with Global Activation hotkeys causing keys to stick in both games

2.0 RC2
- Non-subscriber access to the beta has been opened.  Options that do not work for non-
  subscribers are hidden to reduce confusion (with the exception of the options shown
  directly in the tray window's options menu. e.g. Automatic Tiling, etc)
- Version numbers from now on will be tracked separately for each plugin
- Dark Age of Camelot (1.0 B1):
  * Dark Age of Camelot support is now included.  We have tested with Trials of Atlantis
    client.  Please provide feedback on which clients do or do not work, as well as any
    issues you may find
- EverQuest (2.0 RC2):
  * Right clicking anywhere on the window with the mouse released no longer causes the
    context menu to pop up.  This was a bug.  It will pop up if you right click on the
    caption bar at the top, though
  * Misc fixes

2.0 RC1
- Removed first profile's name and window title lock (may cause your first profile to
  disappear until you remake it if you already had WinEQ 2.0, sorry!)
- Added support for Non-English keyboards
- Fixed problems with keyboard state reset not resetting ctrl/alt/shift
- Added "right" ctrl and alt keys to the hotkey possibilities (otherwise, left is assumed).  
  Note that the localized word "Right" (e.g. DROITE in French, etc) is placed BEFORE the 
  key name, although this may be incorrect for your language
- Replaced the default Windows context menu (e.g. the one that has Move, Minimize, Close options)
  with our context menu
- "Lag" / low framerate issue that began in B5 solved.  EQPlayNice was the culprit, and the
  problem was that the default mode in foreground was inadvertently being forced to CPU Limiting
  rather than FPS limiting

2.0 B5
- Fixed global activation hotkeys
- Fixed problem with previous/next session keys
- Memory indicator should correctly display memory above 2GB
- EQPlayNice integration is now built into WinEQ 2.0.  There is not currently an option to disable
  it entirely.  With EQPlayNice, WinEQ can now keep the mouse cursor position when releasing or
  recapturing the mouse, in sync with the game.  Auto-releasing the mouse on window edges would
  unfortunately take too much processing time and cause unwanted lag, so that is not implemented.
- Added a few custom resolutions: 125%, 150%, 175%, 200% and 250% of the windows display mode, for
  people who want to scale the window down (not to mention use up a lot more video RAM and produce
  more lag!).
- Added option to prevent the game from changing the gamma, since doing so also changes the gamma of
  every other window
- Added process termination on Alt+F4
- Added option to store current window settings to a preset
- Fixed the black screen auto-fixing
- WinEQ should now keep the last-used EQ account per profile just like 1.38

2.0 B4
- Did a lot of work on mouse handling
- Made some changes so that the EQ window can update correctly at all times (zoning, loading, etc).
  Hopefully this doesn't cause too many problems
- Picture-in-Picture should be fully functional, please report any issues you find with it.  To
  enable PIP, you must have the option turned on in the tray program (does not currently save), and
  in each profile you wish to allow the PIP windows in.  Any session can *be* a PIP window whether
  its option is on or not
- Tiling should be fully functional, please report any issues you find with it as well.  For auto-
  tiling, you must enable auto-tiling in the tray program (does not currently save)
- Minor UI improvements (prefs window and context menus)
- Made some changes to the text overlay system that will hopefully make it work correctly on the
  systems it was not working on, and if not it should not cause ridiculous lag anymore
- WinEQ 2.0 should now take care of black screens caused by Windows screensavers or the login screen
  automatically (like 1.38)
- Global hotkeys are implemented, but slightly different from 1.38.  There are 8 global activation
  hotkeys, by default CTRL+ALT+1 through CTRL+ALT+8.  They can be changed in the hotkeys settings
  section.  The hotkeys will be assigned by first available as the EQ windows are created.
- Custom window titles enabled

2.0 B3
- Added a path selection button for path preferences (e.g. EQ Path)
- Fixed issue of missing keys in input system (some keys would get stuck down when alt-tabbing
  with them down, because our input system did not have the information for those keys)
- "EverQuest" submenu in the tray icon's context menu is now "Launch EverQuest", and the submenu
  now contains a list of profiles.  The Patch, Test, and Sound options for profiles are now
  working
- Implemented Memory Indicator, which is in the new "General" preference category.  Toggling
  the memory indicator via the hotkey does NOT change the setting for other sessions, but may
  later
- Added visible low memory warnings.  You cannot disable these warnings, and they will show at
  the same time WinEQ 1.38 would have logged "Lowest memory thus far" for both system and 
  texture memory
- Preferences window now shows (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED) in the description of settings that are not
  yet implemented
- NOTE: The "WinEQ 2.0 Closed Beta - EverQuest" text that is unremovable in the upper left will
  be removed for the final beta and release

2.0 B2
- Lots of work done on preferences system, and it is now enabled.  Some preferences are still
  not entered in this new system that are in the ini file (WinEQ-EQ.ini).
- Fixed bug where EQ path and a couple other settings were not being kept, which stopped
  several people from being able to use WinEQ 2.0 B1 at all.

2.0 B1
- Initial Closed Beta release, nothing to relate "changes" to
